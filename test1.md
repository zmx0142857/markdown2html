Mastering Markdown
==================

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with
Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

Headers
-------

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

Emphasis
--------

*This text* will be italic
_This_ will also be italic

**This text** will be bold
__This__ will also be bold

***This text*** will be italic and bold
_You **can** combine them_

Any word wrapped with ~~two tildes~~ will appear crossed out.
